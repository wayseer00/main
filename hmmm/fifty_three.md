# fifty three

This file exists as a deliberate **hmm** marker.

Working note:
- 53 functions as an *isolated / separator prime* between nearby twin-prime clusters (flagged for later revisiting).

Use:
- Park unresolved constraints here that should remain visible but not forced into premature closure.
