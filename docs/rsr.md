Got it. Then it needs to be expressed in the grammar and tone of the Interdependent Way—clear, structural, systemic, and tied to responsibility, competence, and the hidden scaffolding behind every created thing.

Here is a version that fits seamlessly into the Interdependent Way as a formal concept.

THE RESPONSIBILITY–STEP RATIO

(A Fiddly Bit of Article IV / V domain: competence, contribution, and required spheres)

Definition

The Responsibility–Step Ratio (RSR) measures the density of responsibility embedded in any created thing. It compares the number of steps required to produce a product with the number of distinct spheres of responsibility required to fulfill those steps.

It reveals how interdependent the product is—and what layers of society are involved in its existence.

Formal Expression

Let:

Steps = the discrete actions necessary to produce the product

Spheres = the domains of responsibility required (material, skill, safety, oversight, logistics, energy, compliance, etc.)


Then:

\text{RSR} = \frac{\text{Total Spheres Required}}{\text{Total Steps Required}}

Interpretation

RSR ≈ 1.0 → A product whose responsibility load matches its steps. Individually producible.

RSR 1.2–2.5 → A product requiring multiple overlapping spheres. Cooperative production.

RSR 3.0+ → A product dependent on complex civilization. It cannot exist without systems, institutions, and coordinated competence.


Purpose Within the Interdependent Way

The RSR clarifies:

The true cost of creation (not price; responsibility)

The dependency chain each product requires

The minimum competence required to sustain a society’s artifacts

Where responsibility must be acknowledged, upheld, or repaired

Who contributes versus who benefits

Whether a population can sustain its own tools


It anchors the principle:

> Every object carries a burden of responsibility proportional to what is required to bring it into being.

EXAMPLES (Framed Interdependently)

1. A Clay Cup

Steps: gather clay, shape, dry, fire, glaze

Spheres: material knowledge, shaping skill, kiln access (energy)


\text{RSR} = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6

Interpretation:
Mostly individual competence. Low systemic dependency.


---

2. A Bicycle

Steps: ~6

Spheres: metalwork, machining, mechanical assembly, safety, coating/finishing, QC


\text{RSR} = \frac{8}{6} \approx 1.33

Interpretation:
Small-team interdependence. Distributed skill domains.


---

3. A Smartphone

Steps: ~10 major

Spheres: >30 (electronics, semiconductors, optics, software, supply chain, cybersecurity, logistics, energy, etc.)


\text{RSR} = 3.0+

Interpretation:
High-civilization artifact. It exists only because millions cooperate, knowingly or otherwise.

WHY THIS MATTERS TO THE INTERDEPENDENT WAY

Because responsibility is the currency of survival.

Because every product is a surfaced trace of countless unseen competencies.

Because interdependence is not optional—it is measured in the artifacts of a society.

Because if a population cannot meet the responsibility-load implied by its artifacts, it collapses.

The RSR allows:

evaluation of sustainable competence

comparison between cultures

identification of fragile dependencies

clarity of contribution and cost

correction of imbalances before they become failures


This fits within your broader framework as one of the “hidden mechanics”—a diagnostic instrument.
