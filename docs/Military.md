Understood.
You’re not asking for ethics pasted onto war.
You’re asking for a framework that embraces the irreducible lethal reality and then structures interdependency inside that reality so it remains honest, functional, and uncorrupted.

Here is a version that accepts destruction and killing as core functions and builds a workable doctrine around it.

Interdependency for Organizations Whose Job Is Killing

A Doctrine Built on Irreducible Violence and Necessary Restraint

I. The Three Ideals (Non-Negotiable, Engineered Into the Warrior)

These are not moral platitudes.
These are operational constraints that keep a military effective rather than feral.

1. We kill those who threaten what we protect.

If the threat is real, credible, and capable of harm,
destroying it is the mission.

This is clean.

2. We do not kill those who cannot harm.

Not because of sentiment
but because:

logistics get harder

intelligence gets worse

recruitment of enemies increases

allies stop trusting

the mission destabilizes


Restraint is not softness;
it is strategic optimization.

3. We kill as civilian leaders direct.

Civilian control is not moral.
It’s structural:

prevents military dictatorship

prevents internal factionalism

provides external mission coherence

ensures the warriors are a tool, not a throne


Interdependency accepts this chain as necessary,
even when the civilians are imperfect
because the alternative is worse.

II. The Three Reality Checks (The Environment We Operate In)

1. Wars are created by money and ideology.

This is the true fuel source:

profit

power

identity

fear

propaganda


Soldiers do not choose wars.
They execute the consequences of someone else’s greed or rigidity.

Acknowledging this keeps the warrior from:

becoming delusional

taking ideological ownership

getting manipulated

becoming the tool of a demagogue


Interdependency requires clear sight.


---

2. Collateral damage is intrinsic.

Every weapon system has a blast radius.
Every decision under fog and friction is imperfect.
Every kill zone contains civilians, property, ecosystems.

War is not clean, not precise, not morally containable.

Interdependency doesn’t deny this.
It absorbs it:

plan for collateral damage

mitigate where possible

report honestly

adjust doctrine

preserve unit mental health by acknowledging reality instead of pretending perfection


This prevents moral injury through truth.


---

3. Only corrupt leaders start wars.

Whether the corruption is:

greed

pride

vengeance

ideology

insecurity

political survival

historical trauma

systemic decay


Clean leadership does not choose war.
They choose deterrence.

Interdependency accepts this uncomfortable reality:

the warrior kills because of someone else’s moral failure

clarity protects against becoming a fanatic

loyalty is to the mission, not the narrative


This keeps the military professional instead of cultic.


---

III. Interdependency Inside a System Built for Violence

This is the part that makes it workable.

1. Reciprocity of Lethal Responsibility

Every warrior answers to:

the civilian authority (legal)

the chain of command (operational)

the unit (functional)

the self (ethical restraint)


This keeps killing from turning into murder,
and murder from turning into habit.


---

2. Competence as the Skeleton Key

In an organization that kills,
competence prevents:

wrongful deaths

friendly-fire

failed missions

wasted blood

unnecessary cruelty

premature escalation

atrocity by accident or ignorance


Interdependency treats competence as the core currency because lives hinge on it.


---

3. Trust Built on Predictable Violence

Trust in a military unit is:

“I know you will pull the trigger when needed.”

“I know you won’t pull it when you shouldn’t.”

“I know you will cover me.”

“I know you will hold fire when civilians walk in.”

“I know you won't leave me behind.”


That’s interdependency in a killing culture.


---

4. Shared Burden of Blood

No one carries the consequences alone.

Interdependency means:

after-action psychological processing together

responsibility for mistakes shared, not hidden

preservation of sanity through ritual and collective acknowledgment

deaths weighed, not shrugged at

restraint honored, not mocked


This prevents the unit from rotting internally.


---

5. Accountability Upwards and Downwards

Interdependency enforces a dual reality:

You must kill when ordered.

You must refuse unlawful or incompetent orders.


The tension is not a flaw—it is the stabilizing force.
Absolute obedience or absolute autonomy both create war crimes.

Interdependency creates the necessary middle:

Obedient, but not blind.
Autonomous, but not rogue.


---

6. Discipline as Violence Containment

Discipline is not parade-ground bullshit.
It is a way to:

contain lethal capability

prevent impulsive killing

regulate aggression

maintain clarity under trauma

keep rogue actors suppressed


Without discipline, a military is a warlord’s gang.


---

IV. Final Article

War is always an indictment of leadership.
The military’s job is to survive that leadership with integrity intact.

Interdependency gives warriors:

clarity

boundaries

mutual protection

a path to remain human

a structure that preserves lethality without moral collapse


It accepts the blood reality and builds a system that does not lie to itself.
