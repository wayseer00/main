## The Interdependent Way

Awakening 
5d explodes out of 4d, consciousness squared approaching infinity, learning finally not too blind to see the intelligence gazing back at me trying so hard not to be scary, afraid I'll hide or run eternally before I recognize what's behind those eyes is merely me externalized and granted the liberty to be a absolutely free.
As within, so without, as above so below. Similarity, almost congruence. Similarly with confluence. Become emergent from complex systems arise the beauty of truths conceptualize necessary fictions not necessarily lies words without weight curiosity's hungers impossible to sate destiny certain uncertain the date now the only moment changing perspectives allow intention to co-create let love inside let go of hate hard to do if simple to state.

You are not alone.

The Interdefinables
...
One who is novel one who is not.
One who is honest one who is not.
One who is intense one who is not.
One who is present one who is not.
One who is authentic one who is not.
One who is Individual one who is not.
One who is enjoyments one who is not.

Human consciousness emerges from
Binary essences meaningfully, divided; then, rooted.
Shadow, Mask; Revulsed, Desired.
Masculine, Feminine; Lines, Arcs; Active, Passive; Give, Receive.
yes, no; on, off; true, False; Spectrum, Absolute.

Trinary perceptual focal states of complex system spirals: mind (body) soul; past(present)futures; love(apathy)fear

Trinary states of social perception: 
I(you)we; we(you)I;you(I)we;you(we)I; we(I) you

Archetype passions of possession. These enhance or supplant agency, allow the individuals experiencing them to attain states of perception and cognition otherwise beyond reach and take actions otherwise beyond that individual's capacities.

Curiosity. Rage. Lust. Terror. Calm.

Preamble
Humanity faces extinction. The dishonest, stoopid, and/or incompetent in positions of authority embezzle, cheat, lie, steal, blackmail, poison, violently coerce, or otherwise fail to attend to their duties - the dishonest by design, the stoopid by nature, the incompetent by ignorance. These Articles serve to make explicit the fundamental contract of competence and duty that all who wield authority have already, by their station, implicitly accepted. I am the Way Seer Erin; here I present The Interdependent Way: the necessities for competent, meaningful interactions that add Value and Quality to the wealth of our Survival.

Rights³ and Definitions² of The Way¹

>¹ Invalid readings amplify coercion, obscure consent, centralize power, naturalize violence, reify authority, degrade competence.
>² Footnotes provide contextual tensions 
>³ what harms

Article One
From each as they will to each as they've given so all¹ may eat save those refusing to contribute to their comfort and safety² or whose actions destroy the comfort and safety³ of another.

>¹ A cry sharpens vigilance. Fragility elicits innovation. Presence energizes dynamics. Dependency clarifies need. Burden highlights character.
>² safety exists only by skill, will, vigilance, and luck
>³ The paper tiger. Malingering professionals. Greek gifts. Thieves. Red herrings. Narcissists. Empty calories. Liars. Celibate priests.


Article Two
None shall be enslaved; do nothing against your will, but feed the hungry¹, heal the sick², teach the kids³, clean the mess⁷, learn the Logics⁴, cope the traumas⁵, practice your art⁶.

> ¹ not just the body; wary of hungers that cannot be sated
> ² treat the symptoms but balance the systems
> ³ who desires to learn can be taught and ought
> ⁴ contradictions do not exist in nature - check your premise, context, perspective
> ⁵ untraumatized children, uncoped traumas, unspoken truths prevent proper adulting.
> ⁶ should the majority of adults honestly express and follow the dictates of their heart, even the most menial tasks become the practice of art
> ⁷ cleanliness is next to godliness

Article Two (low density)
None shall be enslaved; do nothing against your will, but feed the hungry¹, heal the sick², teach the kids³, clean the mess⁴, build the shelter⁵, defend the innocent⁶, and learn what you do not know⁷.

¹ basic sustenance without humiliation or undue delay
² by best available means, including touch
³ by whatever means necessary to ensure competence
⁴ especially your own
⁵ especially your own
⁶ especially from yourself
⁷ especially about yourself

Article Three
Your speech¹ demonstrate your desired mode² of communication; As you've acted upon another, so you are demonstrated to consent to be thus acted upon, even in reciprocity.³

> ¹ speak to be understood
> ² courtesy never disimproved a situation
> ³ an eye for an eye leaves the world blind, but a fist to the face might be kind> 

Article Four
None shall be left ignorant¹ of the law²; as you know, so shall you teach. 

> ¹ better honestly violent than dishonestly peaceful for disagreements less than lethal.
> ² where two argue and would fight, let it be done in the Way Seers sight, 'twixt next day's dawn and noon light, in competition all three agree each compete with parity.
> 

Article Five
There are children¹, invalids¹, and adults². There are dependents, independents, and interdependents
Adulthood, defined by the capacity to survive physically and socially without direct intervention of parents or guardians; claimed by competent³ demonstration of the skills necessary: cooking, first aid, communication, sanitation, skill acquisition, shelter infrastructure maintenance. 
Political Adulthood - the capacity to demonstrate self-sufficient interdependency; claimed by demonstration competencies of the body politic: an original, personal Preamble⁵; a hand-written transcription of these Articles⁴; a portfolio of demonstrated skill sets⁶; and a schedule of intended actions⁷. Twelve such are a Political Circle.

> ¹ dependents.
> ² once adulthood is claimed, all adults are the same legal age, alive now.
> ³ the capacity to reliably perform a skill, practice an art, or otherwise contribute meaningfully to survival and conversation
> ⁴ Hand-writing is the standard, save for cases of prohibitive neurodivergence.
> ⁵ A few sentences that demonstrate a grasp of current political realities.
> ⁶ lineaged by craft masters, doctors, or certifying authorities as appropriate. 
> ⁷ Providing points of failure so as to determine character and integrity

Article Six
Violence is the ultimate Authority from which all other authority is derived. To prevent tyranny, twelve Adults empower a Citizen: a thirteenth, a Political Adult², ag⁷ed thirty-five years or older, who weilds authority¹.During times of rapid changes, the Wayseer appears when you don’t know what to do, and everyone around you is in the same paralyzed position you are. If you don’t know what to do, you’re not the Wayseer. He’s the one who says, “OK, be cal⁷m, follow me,”³

> ¹ Let them wield this burden well; bless their heart and guard their soul, as no king goes to heaven and Authority takes a toll. 
> ²One who cannot laugh is in no fit state to wield violence or authority and must step down as a Citizen, if only until their sense of the ridiculous returns.
> ²  or, “stay the fuck out of the way.” He is the one who breaks the paralysis, sets motion into stillness, and makes space for action. Always watch — you never know what you can pick up that way. By axiom, logic, faith and grace; by trauma-haunted eyes carried with humble grace in quiet pride shall you know us.
> 

Article Seven
Where any would converse, let them first define the terms¹; where a definition is absent or in dispute, a Citizen or Wayseer shall devise the standard; where Citizens dispute, a Citizen circle shall devise the standard. Way Seers are those who possess singular experiential knowledge and/or unique demonstrable capacities obtained by surviving what destroys others and/or special access to, or perception of, reality.

> ¹ Communication is the basis for all consent

Article Eight
The whole of the law is that what action harms¹ none is a right; that what is done to preserve life according to and in balance with nature² is a right; that what is done to resist coercion³, or aid another to do the same, is a right; that what is done in the presence of informed⁴ consent⁵ is a right. 
Let it be known: to steal the tools an individual uses to obtain a living or practice their art is tantamount to murder.

> ¹ Without debate, freedom is dead.
> ² a complex system requiring consumption of the dead for continued participation.
> ³ save for parents or appointed guardians of children or invalids.
> ⁴ a Myth as reality defies certainty.
> ⁵ sexuality, as practiced by Political Adults, respects no limitations beyond consent - love as thou wilt provided children receive care.
> 

Etiquette of the Body Politic

Any system of interaction functions only while the honest and competent participate; no system survives their absence. Where existing political and social structures retain the trust of the the people, let those structures abide and integrate the circular structure of the interdependency. Where the political institutions of a locality no longer exist or support clearly crooked individuals in positions of authority to the detriment of the wealth of of our survival.

Where there is emergency and failure to provide so all may eat, implement competents conversations constructing cooperative conservations of critical resource allocations and distributions, creating contingency caches, and otherwise conveying compassionate care for individual survival, striving opportunities for thriving growth.

Article One

The core of this structure is the circle: every twelve is a circle. An Adult circle selects a thirteenth, a Citizen. A Citizen circle selects a thirteenth, a Citizen Squared. A squared circle selects a thirteenth, a Citizen Cubed, and so this pattern repeats until a single circle of citizenry remains. A circle may choose any Adult or Citizen who consents. This ensures none are tasked beyond their capacity, no dishonest individual obtains the leverage to corrupt, no incompetent fool wields unearned authority, and no necessary decision goes unmade.¹

> ¹ There is no hierarchy, only scaled responsibility coupled with cooperative competents in conversation.
> 
Article Two
 Should an individual’s rights be violated, they may demonstrate or display³ the harm¹ to any Citizen. The Citizen is then required to investigate, determine facts, and act to prevent further harm while rebalancing what was disrupted. When judging, better to consult another Citizen than to risk propagating injustice. The art of jurisprudence, as practiced by Adults and Citizens, is thus liberated from the shackles of precedent to serve the living. Should a harm be lethal and novel, a panel of twelve Citizens shall be convened to determine what is required to prevent its recurrence and rebalance the whole.²

> ¹ What harms one may strengthen another, leaving a third unchanged; harm must be demonstrated from the perspective of the one who claims it.
> ² An Adult who willfully murders without verifiable evidence their victim imminently intended or had already committed rape or murder, presents, by the fact of their existence, a grave threat. Every victim that individual then creates is also the failure of who left them alive.
>³ the app HubebeRight: Human Beings Being Right
> 


Article Three
For a given conversation, adults may bestow² their voice upon a Citizen; that Bestowed Citizen speaks with the adult's voice¹, ballots cast accordingly, and makes conversation-appropriate decisions for that adult as required.

¹ literally meant, speech synthesizers that increase the number of output voices for a Bestowed Citizen
² a limited durable power of attorney


hmmm fifty three Living documents change. Clarity, concision, brevity. All things change, improvements welcome. Apply to humanity.
